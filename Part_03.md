# Epitech AWS Workshop - Part 3

## The end

### What now ?

The application is deployed and running. You can access it with the public IP of the instance.

But ... is it really the end ?

### The end ?

No, it's not the end. You can do a lot of things with AWS.

And the last thing you want to do is what we just did. You want to automate the deployment of the application.

### Automate the deployment

Let's look at this link: https://www.terraform.io/ or this one https://opentofu.org/

And let's do it again but with Terraform.

But this time, I'll won't held your hand. You have to do it by yourself.

Have fun !

### The real end (yes this one is the real one)

This is the end of this workshop. I hope you enjoyed it.
